    Main figure 3. Group differences. Origination likelihood for all major phyla and across time after cooling-cooling compared to all other paleoclimate interactions. The red point shows the overall response, gray points per phyla, and brown points response per Era. Gray lines show 95% confidence intervals. The phyla Hemichordata and Nematoda as well as the Cambrian were removed from the analysis due to insufficient data. The red line delineates a log odds ratio of zero. Values above this line indicate a higher probability to originate after cooling-cooling compared to all other paleoclimate interactions

    Supplementary figure 17. Changes in the origination likelihood for all major phyla and across time after cooling-cooling compared to all other paleoclimate interactions. The origination likelihood is expressed as standardized log-odds ratios, where we multiplied the average origination likelihood of each phylum with the number of occurrences for each stage. The standardized log-odds hence additionally show when a phylum was most abundant. Phyla are arranged based on their average origination likelihood, with arthropoda showing the highest and foraminifera the lowest average origination likelihood (compare Fig. 3)
